Enter number of agents, building height and probability of updraft when promted to do so, abiding to any restrictions specified. 


Testing:

To test it is suggested you enter number of agents = 5000, building height = 75 and porbability of an updraft is 0.1

Two desnity maps will be produced along with a CSV file which shows the count of the number of bacteria that have fallen at each location. The CSV file will be produced in your directory, however if the resulting pout put is not within 300x300 then no CSV file will be produced and instead an message will be produced informing you of this.
